# [What license do Sandpack and Nodebox use?](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/resources/faq#what-license-do-sandpack-and-nodebox-use)

Sandpack is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack/blob/main/LICENSE).

The Apache License 2.0 is in the permissive category, meaning that you can do (nearly) anything you want with the code, with very few exceptions. You must include the following in the copy of the code, whether you have modified it or not: the original copyright notice, copy of the license, statement of significant changes that have been made (only if applicable), and copy of the notice file.

**To sum up:**

For **personal usage**, there are no limitations on how you can use Sandpack and you can freely use all of our templates, regardless of whether you are building a private or public project.

For **commercial usage**, you can freely use all Sandpack templates except:

-   `nextjs`, any `vite` template, `astro`, `node`.
-   Any other sandbox that uses Nodebox as a runtime environment.

The templates and sandboxes listed above are covered by the [Nodebox license](https://github.com/codesandbox/nodebox-runtime/blob/main/packages/nodebox/LICENSE) and a [EULA](./EULA.md) that is shipped with the Nodebox runtime, which has some restrictions on commercial usage.
